# Python Practice Projects 🐍

Welcome to **Python Practice Projects** — a collection of Python scripts and implementations designed to help you learn, practice, and master core Python concepts and algorithms.

This repository includes examples of:
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, trees)
- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
- Common coding practice problems
- Practical Python scripts for problem solving
